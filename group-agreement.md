# Group Agreement

## Communication Plan

1. When not together, use slack or text.
1. Don't rush to conclusions, ask everyone for their opinion.

## Conflict Plan

1. Take a vote on whatever the problem is. The majority of the group will decide which direction we go if we cannot unanimously make a decision.

## Work Plan

1. Using sticky notes, keep track of what we are planning, currently working on, and have finished. 
1. We will use the sticky notes to make sure everyone has contributed to each category.

## Git Process

* We will start out working all on the master branch.
* Once we begin working on our individual features, we can go on our own branches.
* When you submit a PR, the other two group members will review it before merging.
